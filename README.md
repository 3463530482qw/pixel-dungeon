Pixel Dungeon
=============

This is a fork of Watabou's Pixel Dungeon. This repo adds no new features,
but aims to make setting up Pixel Dungeon a much easier process which everyone
can easilly build off.

To setup Pixel Dungeon:
# Clone this repo: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/mdsimmo/pixel-dungeon`
# Start Intellij/Android Studio
# Go to File->Open and select the cloned repo
# You're done :)

Note that the PD-classes library is included as a submodule in the 'game-engine' directory. 
If you want to make changes to that library, you'll need to fork the PD-classes library
found here: https://github.com/mdsimmo/PD-classes
